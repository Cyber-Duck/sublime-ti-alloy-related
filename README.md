# Axway Titanium Alloy Related Plugin for Sublime Text 3

This is a Sublime Text 3 plugin to easily navigate around your Axway Titanium Alloy application source code.

Original idea comes from an [Atom Package](https://github.com/chrisgedrim/ti-alloy-related-plus).

## Installation

The best way to install is to use [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) for Sublime Text. Search for "Titanium Alloy Related" as the package name.

## Features & Usage

This plugin allows you to easily and quickly navigate throw the related Alloy files for a given Controller, View or Style file.

You need to have at least one of the files opened (Controller, Style or View file) in order to be able to use this plugin.

By using the key bindings, you can navigate through the associated controller, style or view files.

By using the main menu entry you'll be able to do the same or open all the related files at once.
